# Questionnaire

## Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

OpenAstronomy would like to be a part of Google Summer of Code to reach a new
pool of contributors, develop our communities, and help collaboration between
the member projects. Some of our member projects' past experience with GSoC
shows that it provides a boost to areas which are in need of intensive
attention, as well as adding members to the community who can turn out to be
valuable long-lasting contributors. We would like to help bring these
experiences to a wider variety of projects, all united by the goal of fostering
open source development of astronomy software.

As an umbrella organization with an astronomy focus, we will be able to include
diverse projects (not only Python-based) and accept students with experience
with different languages, while uniting projects with the common goal of
providing tools for the scientific exploration of the Universe.

## How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

At the moment we have 26 potential mentors for this year’s program (listed on
our ideas page).

## How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

In order to be accepted as a mentor, developers need to have made major code
contributions to their respective project, and be active contributors to date.
They must also be in a position to dedicate enough time to properly mentor GSoC
students.
Some of the potential mentors have been GSoC mentors since 2013. Therefore, they
are deeply engaged with the sub-organisations.

When the selected students are announced, each suborganisation will
email to their respective forums and post in their blogs an introduction to the
students, their projects and their mentors.
Making visible to the community not just the work of the students (which they
will able to follow through the required public blog posts) but who are the
mentors behind thee projects.

Mentors will monitor their students as they prefer but they will have dedicated
time on each sub-organisation weekly teleconferences to discuss their
development and update the admins and other mentors on progress and problems
encountered.

/is that engaging enough? A Party or chocolates will have more effect,
something that will make others to want to mentor in the future/

## How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

The students are asked to keep a blog up to date with their progress and email weekly status reports to the mentors in scrum format.
With the help of the mentors and guided by the timeline in their application,
students will be expected to set milestones and make them publicly available
(along with their blog).
All the projects will have at least one experienced mentor who will 
know how to handle problems or delays and help the students to 
identify the causes that may be dragging them behind.
The organisation admins will keep a close eye on the projects with less
experienced mentors to resolve problems before they arise.
The admins will also monitor the progress of all the students based on weekly
updates from the mentors.
If despite intervention we find the students have fallen behind on multiple
milestones without specific allowable reasons, they will be warned of possible
failure, in the hopes that this will put them more on track. 
If this does not succeed, they will be failed.

## How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

Creating a community between different projects within astronomy is the purpose
of OpenAstronomy, and it is very important to us that our students participate
in this community. We have created a page with guidelines on what students
can do to get involved with the OpenAstronomy community and increase their
chances of their application being accepted. To ensure students interact with
our communities before their applications are submitted, we will require that
students submit at least one patch, which will involve the students interacting
with the developer community. Students will also be required to participate in
the various communication channels used by the various projects. Once we select
students, we will require them to further discuss their project ideas with the
community before the coding period starts.

These guidelines have already been successful applied as part of our previous
involvement in GSoC and the ESA Summer of Code programmes.

## How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?

Because the OpenAstronomy projects are community-developed projects,
we take special care to welcome all new people to our communities.
This applies as much to GSoC students as any other new member.

As many solar and astrophysicists are new to Python, we will invite the
students to give tutorials about their contribution to astronomy and
astrophysics institutes near their home location.
This will help the students get a better understanding of the needs of the
community and to get closer to the users and the field.
This may provide the student a big push in their career, and open new doors in
the astronomical research world.
Furthermore, many of the students involved in past GSoCs with Sunpy and Astropy
have gone on to be valuable long term contributors.

To further integrate students into their projects, we will ask the students to
spend a small fraction of their time reviewing others’ pull requests. We will
ask them to help review one pull request per week.

## Has your org been accepted as a mentoring org in Google Summer of Code before?

No

## Are you part of a foundation/umbrella organization?

Yes

### which one?

OpenAstronomy as a whole is not, but Astropy is under NumFOCUS

## What year was your project started?

- [x] 2015

## Anything else

OpenAstronomy started in 2015 as an umbrella organization for GSoC and to
coordinate other activities such as workshops and tutorials.

The organizations under the umbrella were created at different times: the yt
project in 2007, ChiantiPy in 2010, SunPy and Astropy in 2011 and finally Julia
Astro in 2012.

SunPy and Astropy have been participating on GSoC under the Python
Software Foundation umbrella. David PS., Stuart M., Erik T. and Thomas R. have been
sub-organizations admins since 2013.
