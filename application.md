# Questionnaire

## Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

OpenAstronomy is a collection of projects united by a common goal to foster open
source development of astronomy software. We are submitting this application
together in order to strengthen collaboration between the different projects,
for example by offering project ideas that extend across multiple packages, in
order to reduce duplication of efforts and strengthen interoperability. As an
umbrella organization with an astronomy theme, we will be able to include
diverse projects (not only Python-based) and accept students with experience
with different languages, while uniting projects with the common goal of
providing tools for the scientific exploration of the Universe.

By participating in GSoC as an umbrella, we aim to improve the experience for
both students and mentors alike, while reducing the administrative overhead.
We have successfully participated the last two years positioning us as the
reference hub of open source astronomy.

## How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

20+

## How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

All the mentors are volunteers, but some of them are new in the programme. For
this reason the new ones will be paired with an experienced mentor. Each
sub-organisation has weekly teleconferences to discuss their development, in
these calls they will dedicate a time for the GSoC mentors and students to
update the progress and problems encountered.

Mentors are encouraged to use a particular room in the real-time chat systems
put in place by the organisation so they know they can reach their students at
any time (It's expected that the students are connected during their working
hours).

Additionally, to reward the work of the mentors we started last year to
issue openbadges - http://openastronomy.org/badges/SoC/mentor/badge-image.png

## How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

The students are asked to write fortnight posts in a blog with their progress[1].
Additionally, from the timeline in their application and with the help of the
mentors a number of milestones will be set. All this information will be
publicly available.

In case of problems or delays most of the mentors have experience in help the
students to identify the causes that drag them behind. The organisation admins
will keep a close eye on the projects with inexperienced mentors to be able to
help before it’s too late. 

If after all the efforts the student doesn't show interest or disappears, the
student will be failed.

## How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

Working together with the community is a very important aspect for all of the
sub-organisations under OpenAstronomy. We have created a page with guidelines on
what students can do to increase their chances to be accepted into the
OpenAstronomy GSoC programme. To ensure students interact with our communities
before submitting their applications, we require that they submit a patch -
ensuring therefore their interaction with the existing developer community. The
students are encouraged to further discuss their project ideas within the whole
community using the communication systems available. They are expected to be
present on the real-time chat rooms during their working hours, not only to talk
with their mentors but to participate in the community discussions with other
students and members of the community.

Finally they are required to post a blog every fortnight, showing the broader
community their progress. The comments left by the community will show the
impact of their work.

## How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?

We aim to involve all new people with our communities as much as we can. GSoC
students will be encouraged no less. We hope to convince them of the attractive
and usability that our projects have for the long term. As many astronomers and
astrophysicists are new to these tools and good programming practices, we will
invite the students to give tutorials about their contribution to astronomy and
astrophysics institutes and occasionally at international conferences. This will help the students to get
a better understanding of the needs in the community and to get closer to the
users and the field. This can also provide the student a big push in their career,
and open new doors. Some of our students have found internships with NASA or STScI.

To further encourage students, we ask the students to spend a small fraction of
their time reviewing others’ pull requests - creating a habit that they may
follow once GSoC ends.
Several of our previous students became mentors themselves in later years.

## What year was your project started?

- [x] 2015

## Where does your source code live?

http://openastronomy.org/members/

## Anything else we should know (optional)?

OpenAstronomy started in 2015 as an umbrella organization for GSoC and to
coordinate other activities as organizing conferences and workshops.
Our members page provide links to all of them. Some of the
organizations under the umbrella have been participating in GSoC since 2013
under the Python Software Foundation. All these summers have been very
successful to our projects, providing strong pushes to our development. The
experience for students and mentors have been incredible - GSoC rocks!
