# Questionnaire

## If you did not choose "veteran" in the checkbox, have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)?

This organisation is new and this is our first year applying as such, however,
two of our sub-organisations (Astropy and SunPy) have participated in GSoC under
the Python Software Foundation umbrella, both in 2013 and 2014.

## Why is your organization applying to participate in Google Summer of Code 2015? What do you hope to gain by participating?

OpenAstronomy is a collection of projects united by a common goal to foster open
source development of astronomy software. 
We are submitting this application together in order to strengthen collaboration
between the different projects, for example by offering project ideas that
extend across multiple packages, in order to reduce duplication of efforts and
strengthen interoperability. 
As an umbrella organization separate from the Python Software Foundation, we
will be able to include other projects that are not exclusively Python-based and
accept students with experience with different languages, while uniting projects
with the common goal of providing tools for the scientific exploration of the
Universe.

By participating in GSoC as a group, OpenAstronomy aims to improve the
experience for both students and mentors alike, while reducing the
administrative overhead. 
Both the SunPy and Astropy projects have participated in GSoC in 2013 and 2014
under the Python Software Foundation umbrella organization, and the experience
was highly successful for both organisations (a total of 4 and 10 students
completed their projects during the 2013 and 2014 programs, many of them with
exceptional performance, and no students were failed). 
We hope that we can replicate and share this experience with other projects as
part of the OpenAstronomy organization.

## How many potential mentors do you have for this year's program? What criteria did you use to select them?

We have 17 potential mentors for this year’s program (listed on our ideas page).
In order to be selected as mentors, developers need to have made major code
contributions to their respective project, and be active contributors to date.
These are therefore 'core' developers that understand the code base very well.
They must also be in a position to dedicate enough time to properly mentor GSoC
students. 
A number of the mentors have been GSoC mentors in 2013 and 2014.

## What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?

Students are expected to be in regular contact with the mentors assigned and
with the community via the project’s regular communication channels. 
This include IRC, mail-list, or dev-Google+ hangouts. 
The students will also be required to write blog posts on a regular basis on the
OpenAstronomy site. 
Additionally, the mentors and the student have to agree on a time to meet every
week for at least one hour to discuss the evolution of the project. 
The students are also expected to have their repositories on GitHub or BitBucket
up to date, so the mentors and all community members can review the progress as
it proceeds.

If a student simply stops communicating, or otherwise does not show progress,
the student will be explicitly warned that their project is in jeopardy via
e-mail (if they have stopped communicating) or in the regular weekly meeting.
If they still do not respond or return to making progress, the mentors and org
admins will terminate the project and give the student a failing grade, unless
the student has extenuating circumstances.
Any code the student has developed up to that point will be present in the
GitHub or BitBucket repositories, so that their project can be continued by
project developers or a hypothetical future GSoC student.


## What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?

All students will be assigned two mentors in case one of them becomes
unavailable at any point. 
We will also ensure that the students regularly interact with the main developer
list and communicate with others on the project, so that in the unlikely case
that both mentors become unavailable, other mentors and developers will be able
to step in and help the student.

In case either of the mentors have either a temporary or permanent conflict
preventing them from completing their mentorship role, the sub-organisation’s
administrator will be responsible for finding a new mentor. 
The projects within the OpenAstronomy project are large enough that it will not
be difficult to find another mentor that is familiar with the project.

## What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before and during the program?

Working together with the community is a very important aspect for all of the
sub-organisations under OpenAstronomy. 
We have created a page with guidelines [1] on what students can do to increase
their chances to be accepted into the OpenAstronomy GSoC programme. 
To ensure students interact with our communities before their applications are
submitted, one of the requirements of applications will be that students must
submit at least one patch as part of their application, which will necessarily
require that the students interact with the existing developer community. 
Once we select students, we will encourage them to further discuss their project
ideas with the community before the coding period starts in earnest.

Each sub-organisation provides a number of communication channel to its users
and developers. 
These include weekly Google hangouts, email lists, as well as an IRC chat room.
We will expect the students to make use of all of these channels during their
projects.
We also will make specific requirements for the students which include
weekly meetings with their mentors as well as weekly blog posts on the
OpenAstronomy site describing their progress. 
They will also be invited to participate in the creation of posters,
presentations and/or tutorials to show in upcoming scientific conferences.
Students (as all contributors) will be required to write up a user guide and
full documentation for their contribution. 
This will be reviewed by the community through the GitHub and BitBucket comment
and annotation pull request platform.

If the work done leads to a research publication, the student will be invited to
collaborate in the preparation of the publication. 
These guidelines have already been successful applied as part of our previous
participations in GSoC and the ESA Summer of Code programmes.

## What will you do to encourage your accepted students to stick with the project after Google Summer of Code concludes?

We aim to involve all new people with our communities as much as we can. 
GSoC students will be encouraged no less. 
We hope to convince them of the attractive and usability that our projects have
for the long term. 
As many solar and astrophysicists are new to Python, we will invite the students
to give tutorials about their contribution to astronomy and astrophysics
institutes near their home location.
This will help the students get a better understanding of the needs in the
community and to get closer to the users and the field. 
This may provide the student a big push in their career, and open new doors in
the astronomical research world.
Over the years various students have been giving talks at astronomical
institutes in Austria, England, Ireland and India.

To further encourage students, we will follow the example set by other GSoC
projects (such as SymPy) and ask the students to spend a small fraction of their
time reviewing others’ pull requests. 
We will ask them to help review one pull request per week, which should be no
more than a 5% time commitment.

## Are you a new organization who has a Googler or other organization to vouch for you? If so, please list their name(s) here.

Astropy and SunPy have participated successfully in GSoC under the Python
Software Foundation (PSF) umbrella in 2013 and 2014. 
The PSF is vouching for OpenAstronomy for this year.

## Are you an established or larger organization who would like to vouch for a new organization applying this year? If so, please list their name(s) here.

No


## Is there anything else we should know or you'd like to tell us that doesn't fit anywhere else on the application?

No
