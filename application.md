# Questionnaire

## Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

OpenAstronomy would like to be a part of Google Summer of Code to reach a new
pool of contributors, develop our communities, and help the member projects
collaborate better.
Some of our member projects' past experience with GSoC shows that it provides a
boost to areas which are in need of intensive attention, as well as adding
members to the community who can turn out to be valuable long-lasting
contributors.
We would like to help bring these experience to a wider variety of projects, all
united by the goal of fostering open source development of astronomy software.

We are submitting this application together in order to strengthen collaboration
between the different projects, for example by offering project ideas that
extend across multiple packages, in order to reduce duplication of efforts and
strengthen interoperability.
As an umbrella organization with an astronomy theme, we will be able to include
diverse projects (not only Python-based) and accept students with experience
with different languages, while uniting projects with the common goal of
providing tools for the scientific exploration of the Universe.

By participating in GSoC as an umbrella, OpenAstronomy aims to improve the
experience for both students and mentors alike, while reducing the
administrative overhead.
Both the SunPy and Astropy projects have participated in GSoC from 2013 to 2015
under the Python Software Foundation umbrella organization, and the experience
was highly successful for both organisations (a total of 12 students completed
their projects during these years, many of them with exceptional performance).
Additionally the yt project participated last year under NumFocus with positive
results. 
We hope that we can replicate and share this experience with other projects as
part of the OpenAstronomy organization.

## How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

At the moment we have 26 potential mentors for this year’s program (listed on
our ideas page).

## How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

In order to be selected as mentors, developers need to have made major code
contributions to their respective project, and be active contributors to date.
These are therefore 'core' developers that understand the code base very well.
They must also be in a position to dedicate enough time to properly mentor GSoC
students.
A number of the mentors have been GSoC mentors in all the editions since 2013.
How will you keep mentors engaged with their students? Each sub-organisation has
weekly teleconferences to discuss their development, in these calls they will
dedicate a time for the GSoC mentors and students to update the progress and
problems encountered.

/is that engaging enough? A Party or chocolates will have more effect,
something that will make others to want to mentor in the future/

## How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

The students are asked to keep a blog up to date with their progress.
With the help of the mentors and guided by the timeline in their application,
students will be expected to set milestones and make them publicly available
(along with their blog).
All the projects will have at least one experienced mentor which will 
know how to handle problems or delays and help the students how to 
identify the causes that may be dragging them behind.
The organisation admins will keep a close eye on the projects with inexperienced
mentors to be able to help before to late.
The admins will also monitor the progress of all the students based on weekly
updates from the mentors via a tracking system.
If despite intervention they find the students have fallen behind on multiple
milestones without specific allowable reasons, they will be warned of possible
failure, in the hopes that this will put them more on track. 
If this does not succeed, they will be failed.

## How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

Working together with the community is a very important aspect for all of the
sub-organisations under OpenAstronomy.
We have created a page with guidelines [1] on what students can do to increase
their chances to be accepted into the OpenAstronomy GSoC programme.
To ensure students interact with our communities before their applications are
submitted, one of the requirements of applications will be that students must
submit at least one patch as part of their application, which will necessarily
require that the students interact with the existing developer community.
We will use this interaction to help determine how to help specific students get
involved in the community as quickly and effectively as possible.
Once we select students, we will require them to further discuss their project
ideas with the community before the coding period starts in earnest.

Each sub-organisation provides a number of communication channel to its users
and developers.
These include weekly Google hangouts, email lists, as well as an IRC chat room.
We will expect the students to make use of all of these channels during their
projects.
We will also make specific requirements for the students which include weekly
meetings with their mentors as well as weekly blog posts on the OpenAstronomy
site describing their progress.
They will also be invited to participate in the creation of posters,
presentations and/or tutorials to show in upcoming scientific conferences.
Students (as all contributors) will be required to write up a user guide and
full documentation for their contribution to be considered successful.
All contributions by the students will be reviewed by the community through the
GitHub and BitBucket comment and annotation pull request platform.

If the work done leads to a research publication, the student will be invited to
collaborate in the preparation of the publication.
These guidelines have already been successful applied as part of our previous
participations in GSoC and the ESA Summer of Code programmes.

## How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?

Because the OpenAstronomy projects are generally community-developed projects,
we take special care to involve all new people with our communities as much as
we can.
This applies as much to GSoC students as anyone else in our communities.
We hope to convince them of the attractive and usability that our projects have
for the long term.
Because many solar and astrophysicists are new to Python, we will invite the
students to give tutorials about their contribution to astronomy and
astrophysics institutes near their home location.
This will help the students get a better understanding of the needs of the
community and to get closer to the users and the field.
This may provide the student a big push in their career, and open new doors in
the astronomical research world.
Furthermore, many of the students involved in past GSoCs with Sunpy and Astropy
have gone on to be valuable contributors to the projects.

To further encourage students, we will follow the example set by other GSoC
projects (such as SymPy) and ask the students to spend a small fraction of their
time reviewing others’ pull requests.
We will ask them to help review one pull request per week, which should be no
more than a 5% time commitment.

## Has your org been accepted as a mentoring org in Google Summer of Code before?

No

## Are you part of a foundation/umbrella organization?

Yes

### which one?

OpenAstronomy ias a whole is not, but Astropy is under NumFOCUS

## What year was your project started?

- [x] 2015

## Anything else

OpenAstronomy started in 2015 as an umbrella organization for GSoC and to
coordinate other activities as workshops and tutorials.

The organizations under the umbrella has been created at different times:
Yt-project started in 2007, ChiantiPy did in 2010, SunPy and Astropy followed in
2011 and Julia Astro in 2012.

Since 2013 SunPy and Astropy has been participating on GSoC under the Python
Software Foundation umbrella, yt-project has also participated in 2015 under
NumFOCUS.
David Perez-Suarez and Stuart Mumford for SunPy, and Erik Tollerud for Astropy,
have helped organize the GSoC participation since 2013. Matthew Turk from
yt-project has also participated in the organisation since last year.
