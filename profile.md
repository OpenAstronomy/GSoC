## Organization description 

*These descriptions will be displayed on the
organization list page (Short Description) and on your organization's page (Long
Description). More details. The Long Description may include limited Markdown.*

### Short Description

OpenAstronomy is an umbrella organisation that includes open source projects
used by researchers and engineers around the world to better understand the
universe.

### Long Description

OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics
projects that are used by researchers and engineers around the world to study
our universe either by analysing the data obtained from amazing instruments like
the [Hubble Space Telescope](http://www.nasa.gov/hubble),
the [Square Kilometer Array](https://www.skatelescope.org/) or
the [Solar Dynamic Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/), developing very
sophisticated numerical models (eg. [FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or
designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft. The analysis of
such data helps multiple types of research from being able to forecast a solar
storms to detect planets in other stars, from understanding how galaxies are
formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.

Open Astronomy currently is formed
by [12 organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools
for different aspects of astronomy. The range of topics covered by these
projects is wide, for example:
- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy,
  providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing,
  tabular data reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific
  file formats;
- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing
  solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics
  data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code;
- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and
  library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.
- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general
  astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia
- And more!

As a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the
different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among
our users on the capabilities of our "sister" projects.

### Proposal Tags
*Enter tags that students can select (one) from and apply to their own proposals to help organize them. Examples: New Feature, Optimization. You can also use these to designate "sub-organizations" if you are an umbrella organization.*

astropy, sunpy, heliopy, plasmapy, juliaastro, glue, sherpa, poliastro, timelab
