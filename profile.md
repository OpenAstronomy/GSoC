## Organization name
OpenAstronomy

## Organization description OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source
astronomy and astrophysics projects. It currently includes the following
projects: Astropy, SunPy, yt and ChiantiPy. 
The range of topics covered by these projects is wide: Astropy is a general
library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates,
image processing, tabular data reading and writing, units and support for
astronomy-specific file formats. 
SunPy provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with
clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar
specific analysis and visualisation code. 
The yt project is a Python package for analyzing and visualizing volumetric,
multi-resolution data. ChiantiPy is a Python interface to the CHIANTI atomic
database, which allows users to characterise the properties (temperature,
density, velocity) of observed stars from spectra.
As a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations
between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the
awareness among our users on the capabilities of our "sister" projects.
