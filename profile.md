organization list page (Short Description) and on your organization's page (Long
Description). More details. The Long Description may include limited Markdown.*

### short (180)

OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source
astronomy and astrophysics projects. Formed at the moment by the
Astropy, SunPy, yt, ChiantiPy and  astrojulia projects.

### long (2000)

OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source
astronomy and astrophysics projects. It currently includes the following
projects: Astropy, SunPy, yt, ChiantiPy and  astro julia. 
The range of topics covered by these projects is wide: Astropy is a general
library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates,
image processing, tabular data reading and writing, units and support for
astronomy-specific file formats. 
SunPy provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with
clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar
specific analysis and visualisation code. 
The yt project is a Python package for analyzing and visualizing volumetric,
multi-resolution data. ChiantiPy is a Python interface to the CHIANTI atomic
database, which allows users to characterise the properties (temperature,
density, velocity) of observed stars from spectra.
As a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations
between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the
awareness among our users on the capabilities of our "sister" projects.

## Proposals
*Guidance for students on how to apply to your organization. Should include any prerequisites or requirements. You may wish to include a template or tips for their proposals. May include limited Markdown.*

# Requirements

Open Astronomy requires that the students do the following before the
application deadline (25th of March 2016):

1. Introduce yourself in the mailing list (or IRC channel) of the organisation
   you want to work with.
2. Create a blog and write something about the project you are interested. You
   will be require to keep an update of your progress in there (at least one post
   every 2 weeks).
3. Contribute at least one patch to the organisation you are applying for. This
   will show that you have been able to set up the developer environment. Check the
   `package-novice` label (or similar) on the issues for each organisation.
