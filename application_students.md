Do you want to participate in OpenAstronomy as part of the GSoC? First, read carefully the
[student application guidelines](http://openastronomy.org/gsoc/student_guidelines.html) and
[other guides available](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/).
Pay close attention to the requirements, as without them we won't consider your application.

Learn from previous successful students (available in the sub-orgs wikis), and
create your own with enough time to get feedback before the deadline.
